I presented this data to the VP, acknowledging his idea's potential but framing it against our primary commitments. He agreed to de-prioritize the project, saving the team from months of wasted work and keeping our core goals on track. I learned that the most effective way to influence up is to frame the discussion around shared goals and objective data, not opinions."
